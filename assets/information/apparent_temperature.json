  "short": " Apparent temperature, often referred to as the \"feels-like\" temperature, is a measure that combines actual air temperature with other factors like humidity and wind to describe how the weather feels to the human body. It provides a more accurate representation of the perceived temperature.\nThe app also define thermal comfort with Predicted Mean Vote, which is a thermal comfort index used in building design and environmental engineering to assess how people perceive indoor environmental conditions. It quantifies human comfort based on factors like temperature, humidity, clothing, and activity levels.",
  "long": "Apparent temperature, also known as the \"feels-like\" temperature, goes beyond the simple measurement of air temperature. It takes into account additional atmospheric factors that influence how we perceive the weather. These factors typically include humidity and wind speed.\n\nHigh humidity can make the air feel hotter because it impairs the body's ability to cool itself through sweat evaporation. Conversely, wind can make it feel colder by removing heat from the body more rapidly. Apparent temperature is often used in weather forecasts to provide a more accurate representation of what it will feel like outside. For example, on a hot and humid day, the apparent temperature might be significantly higher than the actual air temperature, indicating that it will feel even hotter to humans.\n\nApparent temperature is valuable for helping people understand the potential impact of weather conditions on their comfort and safety, particularly in situations where heat stress or cold stress can be a concern. It's a practical tool for making decisions about clothing, outdoor activities, and heat-related precautions.\n\n\nThe app also define thermal comfort with Predicted Mean Vote, often abbreviated as PMV, is a concept used in building design, architecture, and environmental engineering to assess and design indoor environmental conditions for human comfort. It quantifies how people are likely to perceive and evaluate indoor thermal conditions.\n\nPMV takes into account various factors, including air temperature, humidity, air velocity, radiant temperature, clothing insulation, and metabolic activity. It calculates a numerical value, typically ranging from -3 to +3, to represent the thermal comfort level. A PMV value of 0 indicates that the indoor environment is perceived as thermally neutral or comfortable by the occupants.\n\nDesigners and engineers use PMV to create indoor environments that are comfortable for people based on factors like the season, local climate, and the specific activities that will take place within a building. By considering all these variables, PMV helps strike a balance between energy efficiency and occupant comfort in buildings, which is crucial for both human well-being and resource conservation."
