  "short": "Relative humidity (RH) is a measure of the moisture content of the air compared to the maximum amount of moisture it could hold at a given temperature. It is expressed as a percentage and indicates how \"full\" the air is with water vapor.",
  "long": "Relative humidity (RH) is a meteorological term that describes the amount of moisture or water vapor present in the air at a particular time and place, relative to the maximum amount of moisture the air could hold at that same temperature. It is expressed as a percentage.\n\nHere's how it works: Air can hold different amounts of moisture depending on its temperature. Warm air can hold more moisture than cold air. Relative humidity tells us how close the air is to being saturated with moisture. For example, if the relative humidity is 50%, it means the air is holding half the maximum amount of moisture it could hold at its current temperature.\n\nWhen the relative humidity is 100%, the air is holding as much moisture as it can at that temperature, and this often leads to the formation of dew, fog, or precipitation. When the relative humidity is lower, the air is relatively dry.\n\nRelative humidity is a critical factor in weather forecasting and has a significant impact on our comfort and health. High humidity can make hot temperatures feel even hotter and can contribute to discomfort, while low humidity can lead to dry skin, respiratory issues, and static electricity buildup. It also plays a role in various natural processes, including the formation of clouds, rain, and snow, as well as affecting how we perceive and experience weather conditions."
