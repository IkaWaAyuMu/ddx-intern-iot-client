  "short": "Indoor carbon dioxide (CO2) refers to the concentration of carbon dioxide gas within an enclosed or indoor environment. It is a measure of the amount of CO2 produced by human activities, such as breathing and combustion, and can impact indoor air quality and comfort.",
  "long": "Indoor carbon dioxide (CO2) is a metric that quantifies the concentration of carbon dioxide gas within an enclosed or indoor space. Carbon dioxide is a natural component of the Earth's atmosphere, produced through various natural processes, including respiration of plants and animals. However, indoor CO2 levels are primarily influenced by human activities occurring within the space.\n\nWhen people breathe, they exhale carbon dioxide as a byproduct of respiration. Additionally, activities such as cooking, heating, and combustion of fossil fuels (e.g., for heating or cooking) release carbon dioxide into the indoor environment.\n\nExposure to elevated levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) can lead to various health effects, primarily characterized by symptoms such as headaches, dizziness, shortness of breath, increased heart rate, and impaired cognitive function. Prolonged exposure to excessive CO2 concentrations can result in more severe symptoms, including confusion, nausea, and in extreme cases, loss of consciousness. While moderate increases in indoor CO2 levels are generally not considered immediately life-threatening, they can cause discomfort and impair overall well-being. Effective ventilation and monitoring of CO2 levels are crucial to maintaining a healthy indoor environment and mitigating potential health risks associated with high CO2 concentrations. "
