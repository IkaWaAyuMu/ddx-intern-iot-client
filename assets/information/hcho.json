  "long": "Formaldehyde, often referred to by its chemical formula HCHO, is a colorless, pungent-smelling gas that is widely used in various industrial applications, including the production of resins, plastics, and textiles. It can also be found indoors as a component of indoor air pollution. Formaldehyde is released into indoor environments from sources such as building materials, furniture, and household products. Prolonged or significant exposure to formaldehyde can have adverse health effects.\n\nFormaldehyde exposure can lead to a range of health issues, particularly when present at elevated levels. Short-term exposure to high concentrations of formaldehyde can cause irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, leading to symptoms like burning sensations, watery eyes, and coughing. Prolonged or chronic exposure has been associated with more serious health concerns, including respiratory problems, such as asthma exacerbation, and an increased risk of developing respiratory diseases. Additionally, formaldehyde is classified as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), meaning that long-term exposure to high levels of formaldehyde may increase the risk of cancer, particularly in the nasopharynx and respiratory tract. Due to these health risks, minimizing formaldehyde exposure in indoor environments is essential, which can be achieved through proper ventilation, using low-emission building materials, and reducing the use of formaldehyde-containing products."
